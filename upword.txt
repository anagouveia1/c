= What's Upword?

== Answers

1. Yes.

2. No, because f does not come before i (though it does in the word too).

3. Am considering the use of a bubble sort mechanism to go through the characters in a word. If this goes through them and doesn't swap any letters, then it will return true. Else, null. How to do it in a short amount of time is the problem. Could it be done though? You know better than me.

2. 15 min, go to go to the dentist and then work.
