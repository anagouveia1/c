1. Below:

function getx(value) {}
x <- getx()
function gety(value) {}
//Similarly to the suggestion of $x <- add($x, -$y) Would turning a variable false "turn it negative"?
//not(y) <- gety() 
//Following your suggestion though
sum1 = add($x, -$y)
sum2 = add(-$x, $y)
if sum1 < sum2
{
return(false)
}
elseif sum2 < sum1
{
return(false)
}
else
printf('This value should be zero'\n, add1)

2. Here we go:

function getx(value) {}
x <- getx()
//Is Z an open source code? Could I create a round up function to determine what is the next integer ending with zero above my input?
//Say I did that
$variableRUP = roundup(x, 00.0)
//Create a string to hold the values in between my x and the next 10 //P.S. It sure does sound like I'm talking about my love life.
//Gosh I just need a loop.
if (x) < variableRUP 
{
print(x)
x <- add(x+1)
}
{
else 
get(alife);
}

1. Just assignment page.

2. 20 minutes stuck in a looplesshole. I'll still persist, hopefully next time I'll have a chance to come talk to someone about some of the problems I'm needing help with.
